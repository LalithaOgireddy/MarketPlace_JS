- The filter should be **case-insensitive**.

### 3. Contact Information Toggle
- Users should be able to **toggle** between "***" mode and **complete contact information** for each advertisement.
- Initially, display contact information in **"***" mode**.
- Provide a **visual cue** (e.g., a button or clickable text) to toggle contact information.

### 4. Details Button
